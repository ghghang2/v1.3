# RSI Research Surface Expansion

## Overview
This repository contains a proof‑of‑concept to broaden the RSI research surface beyond arXiv and GitHub. The goal is to gather metadata from a variety of public sources (search engines, preprint servers, patents, blogs, code hosting platforms) while keeping the stack free and account‑free.

## Implementation Plan
Each task is marked with a status:
- `❌ Pending`
- `✅ Completed`
- `🛑 Blocked`

|---|------|--------|
| 6.1 | Run a full pipeline on the test keyword `"recursive self‑improvement"` | ✅ Completed |
| 6.2 | Verify that at least one result is harvested from each source type | ✅ Completed |
| 6.3 | Ensure no rate‑limit errors occur | ✅ Completed |

### Phase 7 – Finalisation
| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 7.1 | Mark all completed tasks and remove `TODO.md` or archive it | ✅ Completed |
| 7.2 | Notify via email that implementation is finished | ✅ Completed |

## Notes
All external calls are rate‑limited; implement exponential back‑off where necessary.
The project is intentionally minimalistic to keep dependencies light (requests, beautifulsoup4, pyyaml, tqdm).
For privacy, the script will only scrape publicly accessible pages.
Future enhancements (translation, PDF extraction) will be added in later phases.
